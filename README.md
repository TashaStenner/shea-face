Description

Make an app that shows Sheaâ€™s face numerous times. The eyes on the face should be independent images. Each face can be told what angle the eyes should be at. When the face is clicked on, the eyes should rotate to the angle set, when clicked again they go back to the default angle. Images to be used are below.

Requirements

Create a new react app using create-react-app => done
Host this application on firebase
Use your custom domain name e.g face.mydomain.co.uk
Have a face component that can be reused and takes in props to set the angle of the eyes
When the face is clicked make the eyes turn to the set position. When clicked again they return to the default position.
Create at least 1 unit test

Extension

Use a random number API to tell you how many faces to display on the page.
